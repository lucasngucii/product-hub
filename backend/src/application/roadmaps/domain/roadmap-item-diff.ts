/**
 * Fields whose changes become history rows.
 *
 * Deliberately a fixed, explicit list rather than a walk over every property —
 * see `issue-diff.ts` for the same rationale.
 *
 * An item has TWO lifecycle-ish fields and both are tracked, because they are
 * genuinely different things:
 *  - `phase` (NOT `column`) is the board pool the card sits in. `RoadmapColumn`
 *    is the board's column *configuration* (`key`/`label`/`color`); `phase` is
 *    the item's own field, matching `column.key`.
 *  - `status` is the item's work state (Idea → Planned → In progress → Done).
 *    It is what `ReplaceRoadmapItemsUseCase` reads to stamp `startedAt` /
 *    `completedAt`, so marking an item Done is the single most consequential
 *    thing that happens to it. The spec's §4.3 note once read as "the status
 *    field is `phase`", and the first implementation tracked only `phase`, so
 *    marking a backlog item Done produced ZERO rows. Both are tracked now.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT tracked, each for a stated reason:
 *  - `createdAt` / `startedAt` / `completedAt` — server-stamped consequences of
 *    a `status` change (see the use-case), so logging them would emit a second,
 *    identical-timestamp row for the one event `status` already records.
 *  - `shortId` — server-owned and write-once; it can't change by a user action.
 *  - `imageUrl` — a URL renders as neither a value nor an event worth a row;
 *    same call as `attachments` on an issue.
 *  - `milestoneId` / `objectiveId` / `keyResultId` — the three ids move together
 *    as ONE link change, and `okrLabel` is that same event in readable form, so
 *    only the label is tracked (matching how `roadmapItemId` on an issue is
 *    logged through its label rather than its uuid).

 * identical either way, only the values shown differ. All three entity types
 * agree: titles carry their values, descriptions do not. Nothing is
