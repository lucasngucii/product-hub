   * events that carried those commits already told us, so the head branch is the
   * join: the work pushed to it *is* the work in the PR.

   * The third source keeps rows we already wrote correct. Once merged, a branch
   * is usually deleted and its commits re-delivered under `dev` — so a PR that
