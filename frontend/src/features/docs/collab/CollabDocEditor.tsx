/**
 * The collaborative doc body.
 *
 * Same editor as everywhere else in the product — Editor.js, the one an issue's
 * description uses — bound to the Y.Doc the sync server holds. Note what's
 * missing: there is no `value` and no `onChange` that saves. The document *is*
 * the shared state, and the server renders it back into `docpages.content` on
 * its own debounce. That is the whole reason two people can type in the same
 * paragraph: nobody is PATCHing a whole HTML string over the top of anybody else.
 *
 * Three pieces meet here and each has one job:
 *  · `RichTextEditor` — the editor, unchanged, mounted with the CRDT's blocks so
 *    its ids (and its undo history) match what every other client holds.
 *  · `bindEditorJs` — the two-way binding, which is where all the difficulty is.
 *  · this file — presence: publishing where my caret is and what I have
 *    selected, and drawing everyone else's over the page. Character-level, so
 *    you watch somebody select a phrase, type into the middle of a word or
 *    delete back through one, rather than being told which block they're in.
 *
 * Seeding is not done here. It's the server's job, once, before any client
 * connects; a client that seeded too would duplicate every block.
