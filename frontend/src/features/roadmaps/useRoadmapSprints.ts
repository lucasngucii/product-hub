/**
 * A roadmap's sprints, and which backlog item / task sits in which.
 *
 * Two facts about the data shape everything in this file:
 *
 * 1. **A backlog item has no cycle of its own.** `cycleId` lives on the *issue*;
 *    a roadmap item is an element of `roadmaps.items` and stores nothing about
 *    sprints. So an item's sprints are **derived** from the tasks linked to it —
 *    which is also the Scrum-true reading: a backlog item is delivered by work
 *    committed to sprints, and it may well take two of them. Nothing here writes;
 *    moving an item between sprints means moving its tasks, which is where the
 *    commitment actually lives — that write is `useSprintMove`, which reads the
 *    windows this file derives and turns one into a `cycleId` per task.
 * 2. **A cycle belongs to a team; a roadmap does not.** One item's tasks routinely
 *    span Design / Frontend / Backend, each running its own calendar, so a cycle
 *    *id* means nothing at roadmap level. The unit here is therefore the **window**:
 *    every team's cycle covering 3 Aug – 16 Aug is one sprint as far as this
 *    roadmap is concerned. A team running off-rhythm keeps its own entry rather
 *    than being force-fitted into someone else's — it just shows up as its own
 *    sprint on the list.

   * exact start+end pair, so no team can have two cycles in it. A team missing
   * from the map runs nothing in this window — its tasks can't follow the move.
