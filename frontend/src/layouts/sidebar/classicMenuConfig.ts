/**
 * The **classic** side menu's model: one column, every section of the app stacked
 * in it under titled groups. Selected via Profile → Side menu (`useNavStyle`);
 * the two-level model lives in `menuConfig.ts` as `NAV_AREAS`.
 *
 * The two models are separate on purpose. They arrange the *same* destinations
 * differently — flat-with-headings vs. an area you pick first — and a shared
 * structure would have to be the union of both shapes, which is neither. `NavItem`
 * itself is shared, so a row's icon, badge and `end` rule are defined once.
 *
 * This is a snapshot of the sidebar as it stood before the two-level rebuild, so
 * it has no Bugs row (a bug was reached from its team's board) and no Design
 * patterns row (the two-level menu's More area added those), and People/Settings
 * live in the profile menu — see `PROFILE_NAV_ITEMS`.
