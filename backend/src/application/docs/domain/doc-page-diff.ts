 * lookup in this module, which is deliberately pure (no I/O). Same reasoning
 * as `cycleId`/`parentId`/`projectId` in `issue-diff.ts`.
 *
 * `order` is value-less for a different reason: the fact that a page moved
 * among its siblings is worth a row, but the raw position index is not —
 * nobody reads "changed order 3 → 5" as history. Contrast with `title` (kept
 * value-bearing, see the review note this file's sibling `issue-diff.ts`
 * carries) — a title change's *content* is the event; a reorder's position
 * number is not.
