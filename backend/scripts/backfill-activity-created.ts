/**
 * One-time BACKFILL: write one `created` activity row per existing issue.
 *
 * History starts on deploy day — tasks 6–8 made every *future* write to an
 * issue append a row, but nothing has touched the issues that already exist.
 * They store only a last-writer snapshot (`createdBy`/`updatedBy`), not a
 * sequence of changes, so almost nothing about their past is recoverable.
 * One thing is: `createdBy` + `createdByName` + `createdAt` survive on every
 * issue, so a single `created` row can be reconstructed from them. That is
 * the difference between an old issue opening to a timeline with one honest
 * entry and opening to nothing at all, which reads as "the feature is
 * broken".
 *
 *   npm run backfill:activity-created              # DRY RUN — plan only
 *   npm run backfill:activity-created -- --apply    # write
 *
 * Idempotent: an issue is skipped when it already has a `created` row in
 * `auditlogs`, so re-running (intentionally or by accident) never writes a
 * second row for the same issue. That check is done with a single upfront
 * query — `distinct('entityId', { entity: 'issue', field: 'created' })` — so
 * it costs one round trip regardless of collection size, not one query per
 * issue. Batched: `issues` is streamed with a cursor and inserted in batches
 * of 500 via `insertMany`, so nothing loads a whole collection into memory.
 * A prod run needs an explicit MONGODB_URI (it won't silently hit localhost).
