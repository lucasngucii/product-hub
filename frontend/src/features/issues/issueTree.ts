 *
 * Two deliberate details about the cache entry, both so this can't drift out of
 * sync with the lists beside it:
 * - it is keyed **under `['issues', …]`**, the same prefix `makeIssueHooks`
 *   invalidates, so any create/update/delete refreshes the nested rows too;
 * - it resolves to `{ items }`, the same shape as a list page, so the optimistic
 *   status swap (`setQueriesData` over that prefix) patches a grandchild's status
 *   as happily as a top-level row's — and doesn't crash on the wrong shape.
