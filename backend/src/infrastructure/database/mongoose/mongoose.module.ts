/**
 * Wait for every model's index build and say — loudly — if one failed.
 *
 * Mongoose builds indexes in the background on first use and swallows the
 * outcome (`Model.init().catch(() => {})` inside the Nest integration), so a
 * `createIndex` that fails on disk pressure, times out on a large collection, or
 * is killed by a concurrent build leaves the app booting green with nothing in
 * the log. That is not academic here: without the unique partial
 * `{tenantId, refPrefix}` on `teams`, two teams can take the same ticket prefix
 * and mint the same refs — damage no later fix untangles — and without
 * `{tenantId, refPrefix, refSeq, …}` on `issues` the ID sort is a collection scan.
 *
 * **Deliberately not fatal.** An index build failing is a serious operational
 * problem, but refusing to boot over it turns a degraded API into a total outage
 * — including for the read traffic that does not need the index at all, and for
 * the operator who now cannot use the app to look at the damage. The rule the
 * runbook enforces instead is "boot, then verify the indexes exist before opening
 * traffic"; this log is what makes that verifiable rather than assumed. Anything
 * that must not run without the index checks for it directly (as
 * `backfill-team-ref-prefix` does, refusing to `--apply` without it).

/**
 * Deploy-order hazard, made loud instead of just commented: the issue board's
 * search and MCP's `search_issues` both read `searchText`, which only exists
 * on an issue once `backend/scripts/backfill-search-text.ts` has run against
 * it (every *new* issue gets it for free from `IssueRepository.toDocument()`,
 * but nothing backfills old rows automatically). Deploy this feature before
 * running that script and every pre-existing issue silently loses
 * title/shortId matching — the `description`/`_id` fallback branches still
 * match *something*, so it reads as flaky search rather than the systematic
 * regression it actually is.
 *
 * One indexed `countDocuments` (`{tenantId:1, searchText:1}` on `issues`, see
 * below) at boot, next to `reportIndexBuildFailures` — the app's other
 * "boot, then verify before opening traffic" check, same non-fatal shape: a
 * missing backfill degrades search, not the whole API, so this reports loudly
 * rather than refusing to start.
 *
 * Advisory, never fatal, under every failure mode — same rule
 * `reportIndexBuildFailures` follows via `Promise.allSettled`. The query is
 * wrapped in its own `try/catch` (a network blip, a replica-set election, or
 * a locked `issues` collection during the very deploy window this runs in
 * must not fail `bootstrap()` — `main.ts` calls it as a bare `bootstrap();`
 * with no `.catch()`, so an unhandled rejection here would stop `app.listen()`
 * from ever being reached) and bounded with `maxTimeMS` so a slow collection
 * can degrade this check instead of hanging boot.
