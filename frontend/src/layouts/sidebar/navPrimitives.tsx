 * Every row the sidebar can render, and the state that remembers what's open.

 * favourite, a nav link and a section heading all live here, so how they look and
 * behave is decided in one place. Style one from the page that renders it and the
 * two go out of step.
 *
 * **Both menus render from this file** — `Sidebar` (icon rail + panel) and
 * `ClassicSidebar` (one stacked column). That's deliberate: a fix to the team
 * row's drag, or to how a favourite unpins, has to reach whichever menu the user
 * has chosen, and one copy is the only way that's true.
 *
 * The rows differ in exactly one respect, the optional `collapsed` prop: the
 * classic menu collapses to an *icon rail*, so its rows drop their labels from
 * `md` up. The two-level menu never passes it — collapsing there hides the whole
 * panel and leaves the area rail behind, so its rows are only ever full width.
