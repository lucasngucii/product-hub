 * The filter axes **every** issue board shares — who it's on, who opened it, when
 * it came in, when it was solved.
 *
 * They live here rather than in each page because that's exactly how the boards
 * drifted: `/bugs` grew the two date windows, the task and team boards never did,
 * and none of them could answer "who reported this?". A board composes this block
 * after its own kind-specific axes (status, severity / backlog item, project), so
 * the same four rows sit in the same order in every Filter menu.
 *
 * The people list is manager-only (`useUsers` is gated on `canManageDelivery`), so
 * both people axes lead with a self row — without it a member could not narrow to
 * their own work at all.
