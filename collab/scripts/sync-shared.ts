/**
 * Copies the two modules the browser and this server *must* agree on.
 *
 *   frontend/src/lib/editorjs.ts                    → src/editorjs.ts
 *   frontend/src/features/docs/collab/blockDoc.ts   → src/blockDoc.ts
 *
 * Why a copy rather than a shared package: this service ships as its own
 * container with its own `package.json`, and its Docker build context is this
 * directory — it cannot reach up into the frontend at build time. A workspace
 * package would be the textbook answer and would also mean restructuring both
 * builds for two files.
 *
 * A copy is only safe if it cannot silently drift, which is what `--check` is
 * for: it fails when the generated file differs from the source, so `npm run
 * typecheck` (and anything running it) catches an edit made on one side only.
 *
 * Both files are copied verbatim. That is a constraint on the *sources*, not a
 * coincidence: `editorjs.ts` imports nothing and guards every DOM global it
 * touches, and `blockDoc.ts` imports only `yjs`. Keep them that way — see
 * `src/dom.ts` for the four globals this side has to provide.
 *
 *   npm run sync          rewrite the copies
 *   npm run sync -- --check   fail if they're out of step
