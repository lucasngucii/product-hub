/**
 * The sidebar's information architecture, in two levels.
 *
 * **Level 1 — areas.** The icon rail, now two stops: **Workspace**, everything
 * you do with the product, and **More**, running the workspace itself (admin
 * only). Home, Discovery, Delivery and Quality used to be four separate stops;
 * they are the *phases of one job*, and splitting them across the rail meant a
 * click on the rail before most navigation — so they merged into one panel and
 * kept their names as its headings. The product's own vocabulary is intact;
 * only the hop between panels is gone.
 *
 * **Level 2 — sections + items.** The panel's blocks. Nothing is listed twice:
 * a row has exactly one home, so there's never a second copy to keep in sync.
 * The lead block (what's *mine*) carries no heading — in the panel it reads as
 * the page itself; every block after it is a collapsible heading, so a long
 * panel folds down to the parts you use.
 *
 * A third level exists only where an item genuinely nests — a cycles-enabled
 * team's Current/Upcoming. It is not a place to file more navigation.
